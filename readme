Disk Map Generator script
http://www.telegraphics.com.au/~fthain/sw/list-disks


PURPOSE

This script generates a disk map: a tabular, HTML representation of the
DiskSuite and SCSI configuration of a Sun Solaris system.

A disk map is useful to quickly answer questions like, "what is the SCSI ID of
/dev/rmt/3?", "is there any unused space on any drives?" and "what controllers
are used for this mirror?", "what were the effects of that reconfiguration
boot?" and "what sort of drives are these?".

You can easily get this information from other programs, but it is scattered,
hard to find, and probably unobtainable in a recovery situation. I've also
found that this kind of overview is helpful when coming to grips with an
unfamiliar system.


INSTRUCTIONS

Invoke the script as root, something like this,

# mkdir some/path/hostname-YYYYMMDD
# list-disks some/path/hostname-YYYYMMDD

Execution can take a minute or so on large systems.

By default, disks without any slices in use as swap, mounted filesystems, hot
spares or metadevices are not listed but they can be included explicitly
by passing the appropriate c-t-d- identifiers on the command line.

Tape drives will be shown if they have media loaded. CD-ROM drives must have
media mounted in order to show up.

Disks and slices in use by Veritas, or as raw database extents etc will show
up as unused, if at all.

A slice that is shared by both swap space and a filesystem is likely to be
misrepresented.


RELEASE NOTES

Version 1.0

Tested with Perl 5.002, 5.6 and Solaris SPARC 2.8 and 2.9 and DiskSuite 4.2.1.
Older versions of list-disks have been tested on Solaris SPARC 2.5, 2.6, 2.7.
The HTML may or may not be well-formed. I does render in Mozilla and Safari,
which is sufficient for my purposes. Note to perl hackers: this script
unashamedly uses the accumulate-and-fire "anti-pattern", lots of global
variables, no comments and weird indentation and spacing. So there.


TO DO

- add some indication of multipath I/O, where available
- support ATA devices
